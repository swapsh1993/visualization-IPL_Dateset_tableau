# visualization-IPL_Dateset_tableau


•	**Project Title** – visualization-IPL_dataset-tableau

•	**Brief Summery** – Analysis and visualization of match wins, performance of franchise, Performance of players have been done to get insights of questions using Tableau.

•	**Overview** – With available Dataset, I have created visualizations to describe the findings of Key questions. Here I have used Bar chart, scatter Plot, Pie Chart, Doughnut chart, Slicers from Tableau to describe the findings and also a dashboard has been developed for cumulative description. 

•	**Problem Statement** – You have been provided with the IPL Dataset. Go through the data set carefully and answer the questions listed below, which will eventually guide you and give you some insights about the same.
1.	Find the team that won the maximum number of matches
2.	Find out in which in season did “Mumbai Indian” win the maximum number of matches
3.	How many matches were won by Mumbai Indians in their home stadium (Wankhede Stadium) in the Year 2019?
4.	find out which city has hosted the maximum number of matches
5.	Find out the toss decision ratio for Mumbai Indians whenever they have won a match
6.	Now Mumbai Indians want to select the captain for their team for next season, so they decide to look at the player that had been player of the match for the maximum number of times. Help them get the answer to it
7.	With the help of “mostrunsaverage_strikerate”, Create a new field Strike Rate which can help us compare various players and find out the names of players having top 3 Strike Rate.
8.	What type of relationship do you observe between the number of balls a Batsman plays and number of times he gets Out.

•	**Dataset** – Dataset in MS Excel contains information about matches, most_runs_average_strikerate, teams, teamwise_home_and_away in data tables.

•	**Tools and Technologies** – Here I have used Tableau for developing the project which includes a Dashboard.

•	**Dashboard**– The dashboard contains Doughnut chart showing wins of teams, column charts for maximum hosting city and maximum wins per season for a franchise respectively. Also, bar chart showing possible contender for captaincy and clustered bar charts showing matches won in one season by franchise and toss decision effect on win. Scatter Plot used for visualizing relationship between no. of balls faced and out. Pie charts have been shown to visualize max strike rate batsmen and best performers against no. of balls faced. Finally, Slicers have been involved to filter expected results.
